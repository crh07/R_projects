#RMarkdown Tutorial for generating a (series of) parameterized report(s)

##Possible use cases:  
If you have to generate a report for multiple countries/sites/businesses, etc. that needs to be updated periodically as new data becomes available, this is a good option. For example: quarterly macroeconomic reports for multiple countries; quarterly earnings reports for multiple product lines; quarterly program evaluation reports for multiple hospitals.

Step 1: If you haven't already, install the required packages.

    install.packages(c("knitr", "rmarkdown"))
